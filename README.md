# BigBang

Expands the universe behind stuartsierra **component/update-system** function to [customize](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component#customization) the way your system starts.

### Did you ever wonder how your system started? 

As you can check, every time you call [component/start-system](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component/blob/master/src/com/stuartsierra/component.clj#L151) you are indirectly using ```component/update-system``` fn.   
So let's take a look to this main fn:

```clojure
(defn update-system
  "Invokes (apply f component args) on each of the components at
  component-keys in the system, in dependency order. Before invoking
  f, assoc's updated dependencies of the component."
  [system component-keys f & args]
  (let [graph (dependency-graph system component-keys)]
    (reduce (fn [system key]
              (assoc system key
                     (-> (get-component system key)
                         (assoc-dependencies system)
                         (try-action system key f args))))
            system
            (sort (dep/topo-comparator graph) component-keys))))

```

**Nothing strange at this side!**,we can see a very normal reduce function. Then, behind (component/start-system) call there is a system reduction using an update-component-with-fresh-injected-dependencies-fn. 
And logically, **if we pass a system we get a new-updated-system**.

# The only way to customize your system (by chance!) is update-system 
Also you can find in component/[README](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component/blob/master/README.md#customization) the relevance of update-system fn as **system customization way**:

> Both ```update-system``` and ```update-system-reverse``` take a function as an argument   
and call it on each component in the system. 
Along the way, they ```assoc``` in the updated dependencies of each component.   
The ```update-system``` function iterates over the components in dependency order   
 (a component will be called after its dependencies)....


## But wait!! have you already read the component definition?
Also extracted from the component/[README](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component/blob/master/README.md)
> For the purposes of this framework,    
> a component is a collection of functions or procedures which   
> **share some runtime state**.

**I'd like to highlight here that this share runtime state (or runtime value) is produced at the invocation time of  ```(update-system system component/start)```** 

# Joining new-updated-states with share-runtime-state   

Every update-system reduction returns a new-updated-system (meaning a new state or a new value) but our components need to share the **"last"** new updated state to be updated.

Or in other words, try to find the differences of following two sequence calls:

```clojure
(-> system 
    (component/update-system your-fn your-args)  ;;  new-updated-system 
    (component/update-system component/start)    ;;  started-new-updated-system)
(-> system 
    (component/update-system component/start)    ;;  started-system 
    (component/update-system your-fn your-args)  ;;  new-updated-started-system)
```

In first sequence, your components will start (or will share runtime state) using previous new-updated-system. But in second sequence, your component-share-runtime-state will not use the subsequent update, due that started-system is a previous runtime state from new-updated-started-system

In other words:   
**When we call start we get the running system and further updates over this state are not used in ** 


**Hey!, you don't really need BigBang library to work with stuartsierra/component**

That's true, but if you try to apply several transformations (or you can say reductions) to your system, being able to specify those that have to be invoked  **just before same start-invocation-time** from  those that have to be invoked  **just after same start-invocation-time**,  then BigBang library it's great for it! 

#### Releases and Dependency Information

```clojure
[milesian/bigbang "0.1.1"]
```

```clojure
:dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.6.0"]
               [com.stuartsierra/component "0.2.2"]]
```


##  BigBang Actions and Phases
An action is specified in a very similar way as you use [clojure.core/apply](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/apply) but without using "apply" and enclosing it with brackets 
```clojure
[action-function action-arg0 action-arg1 action-arg2 ...]
```
Actions must at least receive the component instance to update (and anymore args ) and has to return the component updated
```
(defn your-action-function [component & more]
....
;;=> actions should return the updated component
component
)
```

#### BigBang Phases  :before-start :after-start

This keys represents the different phases that your actions could happen.  

All phases recieve a vector of bigbang actions (that are vectors too)

**:before-start** here the actions that need to be applyed at the same invocation time that component/start, but just before component/start  
**:after-start**  here the actions that need to be applyed at the same invocation time that component/start, but just after component/start 


##  BigBang/expand

```bigbang/expand``` needs a common system-map instance and a map with 2 keys ```:before-start :after-start``` 

```clojure 
(defn expand
  [system-map {:keys [before-start after-start]}]
...)

```


## Example

```clojure

;;  construct your instance of SystemMap as usual
(def system-map (new-system-map))


;; instead of calling component/start call bigbang/expand 
(def system (bigbang/expand system-map
                            {:before-start [[identity/add-meta-key system-map]
                                            [identity/assoc-meta-who-to-deps]]
                             :after-start  [[aop/wrap logging-function-invocation]]}))
```

#### Integrate with stuartsierra/reloaded workflow

Replace your reloaded start function for this one

```clojure
(defn start
  "BigBang starting the current development system."
  []
  (alter-var-root #'system #(bigbang/expand % {:before-start [[identity/add-meta-key %]
                                                              [identity/assoc-meta-who-to-deps]]
                                               :after-start [[aop/wrap visualisation-invocation]]})))
```
