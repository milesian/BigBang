### Customize the way your stuartsierra/component system starts

Extracted from component/[README#customization](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component/blob/master/README.md#customization) :

> Both ```update-system``` and ```update-system-reverse``` take a function as an argument   
and call it on each component in the system. 
Along the way, they ```assoc``` in the updated dependencies of each component.   
The ```update-system``` function iterates over the components in dependency order   
 (a component will be called after its dependencies)....

.. then It's not really surprising  that  [component/start-system](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component/blob/master/src/com/stuartsierra/component.clj#L151) also uses ```component/update-system``` to call component/start to get the system started.

### component/update-system: recieves a system and a fn to return a new-updated-system
Let's look the stuartsierra doc and implementation
```clojure
(defn update-system
  "Invokes (apply f component args) on each of the components at
  component-keys in the system, in dependency order. Before invoking
  f, assoc's updated dependencies of the component."
  [system component-keys f & args]
  (let [graph (dependency-graph system component-keys)]
    (reduce (fn [system key]
              (assoc system key
                     (-> (get-component system key)
                         (assoc-dependencies system)
                         (try-action system key f args))))
            system
            (sort (dep/topo-comparator graph) component-keys))))

```

**Great logic and nothing strange at this side** ... Then, when we call [component/start-system](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component/blob/master/src/com/stuartsierra/component.clj#L151) there is actually a call to update-system that it's a reduction on the system that applies any fn to each component after injecting fresh dependencies. And... logically, **if we pass a system and a fn we get a new-updated-system**.

### but... what is the component definition?  
Extracted from the component/[README](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component/blob/master/README.md)
> For the purposes of this framework, a component is a collection of functions or procedures which **share some runtime state**.

For me this **"functions that share runtime state"** is the key that we need to understand in our clojure functional world. And I think that its meaning can easily improved with this extended started-component definition:

#### started-component (a component after component/start)
**a started** component is a collection of functions or procedures wich share some runtime state **produced in component/start** (possibly using other started components, also called dependencies) 

Examples of started components can be a database component with an open connection db, or a webserver component listening on a port opened.

#### joining component/update-system and component/start   

To understand these two fns together, let's find the differences of following two sequence calls:

```clojure
(-> system                                              ;;  {components}
    (component/update-system your-update-fn your-args)  ;;  {updated-components}
    (component/update-system component/start)           ;;  {started-updated-components}
    
(-> system                                              ;;  {components}
    (component/update-system component/start)           ;;  {started-components} 
    (component/update-system your-update-fn your-args)  ;;  {updated-started-components}
```

If we simplify the problem...
```clojure
;; case 1 {started-updated-components}

user> (def system {:a 1})
user> (def system-updated (assoc system :c 3))
user> (def system-started (assoc system-updated :b 2))
user>  (system-started :c)
=> :3

;; case 2 {updated-started-components}

user> (def system {:a 1})
user> (def system-started (assoc system :b 2))
user> (def system-updated (assoc system-started :c 3))
user> (nil? (system-started :c))
=> true
```

Although it is very obvius now (and of course in functional language too): **When we update our system with component/start we get the running system state and further updates over this running system state are not available to this started-system-value**

##  BigBang/expand: compose component/system-updates in component/start invocation time
BigBang goes further in this time distinction to apply updates and lets you compose your update functions just-before-start and just-after-start, meaning boths inside component/start invocation time

```bigbang/expand``` needs a common stuartsierra/system-map instance and a map with 2 keys ```:before-start :after-start``` and for each key a vector of bigbang actions as value

```clojure 
(defn expand
  [system-map {:keys [before-start after-start]}]
...)

```
 
##  BigBang Actions and Phases
An action is specified in a very similar way as you use [clojure.core/apply](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/apply) but without using "apply" and enclosing it with brackets 
```clojure
[action-function action-arg0 action-arg1 action-arg2 ...]
```
BigBang actions are defined as common stuartsierra/update-system actions: at least receive the component instance to update (and anymore args) and have to return the component updated
```
(defn your-action-function [component & more]
....
;;=> actions should return the updated component
component
)
```

#### BigBang Phases  :before-start :after-start

This keys represents the different phases that your actions could happen.  

All phases recieve a vector of bigbang actions (that are vectors too)

**:before-start** here the actions that need to be applyed at the same invocation time that component/start, but just before component/start  
**:after-start**  here the actions that need to be applyed at the same invocation time that component/start, but just after component/start 


## Example

```clojure

;;  construct your instance of SystemMap as usual
(def system-map (new-system-map))


;; instead of calling component/start call bigbang/expand 
(def system (bigbang/expand system-map
                            {:before-start [[identity/add-meta-key system-map]
                                            [identity/assoc-meta-who-to-deps]]
                             :after-start  [[aop/wrap logging-function-invocation]]}))
```

#### Integrate with stuartsierra/reloaded workflow

Replace your reloaded start function for this one

```clojure
(defn start
  "BigBang starting the current development system."
  []
  (alter-var-root #'system #(bigbang/expand % {:before-start [[identity/add-meta-key %]
                                                              [identity/assoc-meta-who-to-deps]]
                                               :after-start [[aop/wrap visualisation-invocation]]})))
```
