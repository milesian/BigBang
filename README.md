# BigBang
### compose component/update(s)-system in component/start invocation time

![image](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8688858/bigbang.png)


[Why did I write this library?](http://tangrammer.github.io/posts/12-12-2014-bigbang.html)

BigBang generalizes the "how and when can you customize your system?" **letting you compose all your component updates in the same component/start invocation time**, but distinguishing those updates that have to happen just-before from those that have to happen just-after component/start.

So you write this code

```clojure

(bigbang/expand system-map
                        {:before-start [[fn1 arg1]
                                        [fn2 arg1 arg2]]
                         :after-start  [[fn3 arg1 arg2]
                                        [fn4 arg1]]})
```

and you get something similar to: 

```clojure 
(update-system system-map #(comp (apply fn4 [arg1]) (apply fn3 [arg1 arg2]) component/start (apply fn2 [arg1 arg2]) (apply fn1 [arg1]))
```

##  BigBang Actions and Phases
An action is specified in a very similar way as you use [clojure.core/apply](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/apply) but without using "apply" and enclosing it with brackets 
```clojure
[action-function action-arg0 action-arg1 action-arg2 ...]
```
BigBang actions are defined as common stuartsierra/update-system actions: at least receive the component instance to update (and anymore args) and have to return the component updated
```
(defn your-action-function [component & more]
....
;;=> actions should return the updated component
component
)
```

#### BigBang Phases  :before-start :after-start

This keys represents the different phases that your actions could happen.  

All phases recieve a vector of bigbang actions (that are vectors too)

**:before-start** here the actions that need to be applyed at the same invocation time that component/start, but just before component/start  
**:after-start**  here the actions that need to be applyed at the same invocation time that component/start, but just after component/start 


## Example

```clojure

;;  construct your instance of SystemMap as usual
(def system-map (new-system-map))


;; instead of calling component/start call bigbang/expand 
(def system (bigbang/expand system-map
                            {:before-start [[identity/add-meta-key system-map]
                                            [identity/assoc-meta-who-to-deps]]
                             :after-start  [[aop/wrap logging-function-invocation]]}))
```

#### Integrate with stuartsierra/reloaded workflow

Replace your reloaded start function for this one

```clojure
(defn start
  "BigBang starting the current development system."
  []
  (alter-var-root #'system #(bigbang/expand % {:before-start [[identity/add-meta-key %]
                                                              [identity/assoc-meta-who-to-deps]]
                                               :after-start [[aop/wrap visualisation-invocation]]})))
```
