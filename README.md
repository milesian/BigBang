# BigBang

Expands the universe behind  [com.stuartsierra.component/update-system](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component/blob/master/src/com/stuartsierra/component.clj#L117) functionality 
 
![image](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8688858/bigbang.png)

Working with stuartsierra/component library enforces us to use **component/update-system** function ([indirectly](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component/blob/master/src/com/stuartsierra/component.clj#L143-L151) or directly) for starting (updating with component/start) our system.    

but... what does update-system actually do?
```clojure 
  "Invokes (apply f component args) on each of the components at
  component-keys in the system, in dependency order. Before invoking
  f, assoc's updated dependencies of the component."
```

BigBang helps you [customize](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component#customization) the way your system starts providing a very simple way. 

In this project so far you'll find only one function :) that it's been thought to be used as a system actions hub.


**Hey!, you don't really need BigBang library to work with stuartsierra/component**

That's true, but if you try to apply several transformations (or you can say reductions) to your system, being able to specify those that have to be invoked  **just before same start-invocation-time** from  those that have to happen **just after same start-invocation-time**,  then BigBang library it's great for it! 

#### Releases and Dependency Information

```clojure
[milesian/bigbang "0.1.1"]
```

```clojure
:dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.6.0"]
               [com.stuartsierra/component "0.2.2"]]
```


##  BigBang Actions and Phases
An action is specified in a very similar way as you use [clojure.core/apply](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/apply) but without using "apply" and enclosing it with brackets 
```clojure
[action-function action-arg0 action-arg1 action-arg2 ...]
```
Actions must at least receive the component instance to update (and anymore args ) and has to return the component updated
```
(defn your-action-function [component & more]
....
;;=> actions should return the updated component
component
)
```

#### BigBang Phases  :before-start :after-start

This keys represents the different phases that your actions could happen.  

All phases recieve a vector of bigbang actions (that are vectors too)

**:before-start** here the actions that need to be applyed at the same invocation time that component/start, but just before component/start  
**:after-start**  here the actions that need to be applyed at the same invocation time that component/start, but just after component/start 


##  BigBang/expand

```bigbang/expand``` needs a common system-map instance and a map with 2 keys ```:before-start :after-start``` 

```clojure 
(defn expand
  [system-map {:keys [before-start after-start]}]
...)

```


## Example

```clojure

;;  construct your instance of SystemMap as usual
(def system-map (new-system-map))


;; instead of calling component/start call bigbang/expand 
(def system (bigbang/expand system-map
                            {:before-start [[identity/add-meta-key system-map]
                                            [identity/assoc-meta-who-to-deps]]
                             :after-start  [[aop/wrap logging-function-invocation]]}))
```

#### Integrate with stuartsierra/reloaded workflow

Replace your reloaded start function for this one

```clojure
(defn start
  "BigBang starting the current development system."
  []
  (alter-var-root #'system #(bigbang/expand % {:before-start [[identity/add-meta-key %]
                                                              [identity/assoc-meta-who-to-deps]]
                                               :after-start [[aop/wrap visualisation-invocation]]})))
```

## BigBang actions available 

Those libs are supported by BigBang

* [tangrammer/co-dependency](https://github.com/tangrammer/co-dependency) co-dependency facility in stuartsierra/component library (Inverse Dependency Inyection)
* [milesian/identity](https://github.com/milesian/identity) identity actions to apply to components and dependencies 
* [milesian/aop](https://github.com/milesian/aop) facility to apply AOP in stuartsierra/component library
